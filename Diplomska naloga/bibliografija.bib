	abstract = {Many laboratories have begun to develop brain-computer interface ({BCI}) systems that provide communication and control capabilities to people with severe motor disabilities. Further progress and realization of practical applications depends on systematic evaluations and comparisons of different brain signals, recording methods, processing algorithms, output formats, and operating protocols. However, the typical {BCI} system is designed specifically for one particular {BCI} method and is, therefore, not suited to the systematic studies that are essential for continued progress. In response to this problem, we have developed a documented general-purpose {BCI} research and development platform called {BCI}2000. {BCI}2000 can incorporate alone or in combination any brain signals, signal processing methods, output devices, and operating protocols. This report is intended to describe to investigators, biomedical engineers, and computer scientists the concepts that the {BC}12000 system is based upon and gives examples of successful {BCI} implementations using this system. To date, we have used {BCI}2000 to create {BCI} systems for a variety of brain signals, processing methods, and applications. The data show that these systems function well in online operation and that {BCI}2000 satisfies the stringent real-time requirements of {BCI} systems. By substantially reducing labor and cost, {BCI}2000 facilitates the implementation of different {BCI} systems and other psychophysiological experiments. It is available with full documentation and free of charge for research or educational purposes and is currently being used in a variety of studies by many research groups.},

	abstract = {This short survey the reviews recent literature on brain connectivity studies. It encompasses all forms of static and dynamic connectivity whether anatomical, functional, or effective. The last decade has seen an ever increasing number of studies devoted to deduce functional or effective connectivity, mostly from functional neuroimaging experiments. Resting state conditions have become a dominant experimental paradigm, and a number of resting state networks, among them the prominent default mode network, have been identified. Graphical models represent a convenient vehicle to formalize experimental findings and to closely and quantitatively characterize the various networks identified. Underlying these abstract concepts are anatomical networks, the so-called connectome, which can be investigated by functional imaging techniques as well. Future studies have to bridge the gap between anatomical neuronal connections and related functional or effective connectivities.},

	abstract = {Multivariate time series analysis is extensively used in neurophysiology with the aim of studying the relationship between simultaneously recorded signals. Recently, advances on information theory and nonlinear dynamical systems theory have allowed the study of various types of synchronization from time series. In this work, we first describe the multivariate linear methods most commonly used in neurophysiology and show that they can be extended to assess the existence of nonlinear interdependences between signals. We then review the concepts of entropy and mutual information followed by a detailed description of nonlinear methods based on the concepts of phase synchronization, generalized synchronization and event synchronization. In all cases, we show how to apply these methods to study different kinds of neurophysiological data. Finally, we illustrate the use of multivariate surrogate data test for the assessment of the strength (strong or weak) and the type (linear or nonlinear) of interdependence between neurophysiological signals.},

	abstract = {In the background of all human thinking—acting and reacting are sets of connections between different neurons or groups of neurons. We studied and evaluated these connections using electroencephalography ({EEG}) brain signals. In this paper, we propose the use of the complex Pearson correlation coefficient ({CPCC}), which provides information on connectivity with and without consideration of the volume conduction effect. Although the Pearson correlation coefficient is a widely accepted measure of the statistical relationships between random variables and the relationships between signals, it is not being used for {EEG} data analysis. Its meaning for {EEG} is not straightforward and rarely well understood. In this work, we compare it to the most commonly used undirected connectivity analysis methods, which are phase locking value ({PLV}) and weighted phase lag index ({wPLI}). First, the relationship between the measures is shown analytically. Then, it is illustrated by a practical comparison using synthetic and real {EEG} data. The relationships between the observed connectivity measures are described in terms of the correlation values between them, which are, for the absolute values of {CPCC} and {PLV}, not lower that 0.97, and for the imaginary component of {CPCC} and {wPLI}—not lower than 0.92, for all observed frequency bands. Results show that the {CPCC} includes information of both other measures balanced in a single complex-numbered index.},
